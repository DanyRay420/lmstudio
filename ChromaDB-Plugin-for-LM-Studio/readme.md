  <h1>üöÄ Supercharge your <a href="https://lmstudio.ai/">LM Studio</a> with a Vector Database!</h1>
</div>
A vector database lets you convert your documents to vectors and search through them using natural language.  For example, you can search with something like "Where in this 1000 page PDF does it discuss something," and the vector database easily pulls the results.  The vector database is connected to the large langauge model in LM Studio, which is responsible for providing a nice summary of the results from the vector database.

# Installation

> First, make sure you're running [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/).  Also, you must have both [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) installed.<br>
<details>
  <summary>ü™ü Windows</summary>
  
### Step 1 - GPU Acceleration Software
* Nvidia GPUs ‚ûú install [CUDA 11.8](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive)
* AMD GPUs
    > Unfortuantely, PyTorch does not currently support AMD GPUs on Windows (only Linux).

### Step 2 - Obtain Repository
* Download the ZIP file containing the latest release for my repository.  Unzip and place this folder anywhere you want on your computer.

### Step 3 - Virtual Environment
* Open the folder containing my repository files.  Create a command prompt and create a virtual environment with this command:
```
python -m venv .
```
* Then "activate" the virtual environment:
```
.\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 4 - Upgrade pip
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Step 5 - Install PyTorch
* Nvidia GPUs:
```
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```
> PyTorch does not currently support AMD GPUs on Windows (only Linux).
* If you're NOT using GPU acceleration:
```
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

### Step 6 - Doublecheck GPU-Acceleration
```
python check_gpu.py
```

### Step 7 - Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

  <summary>üêß Linux</summary>

### Step 1 - GPU Acceleration Software
  * Nvidia GPUs ‚ûú install [CUDA 11.8](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive)
  * AMD GPUs ‚ûú install ROCm version 5.4.2 according to the instructions [HERE](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/deploy/linux/quick_start.html) and [HERE](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/deploy/linux/index.html)

### Step 2 - Obtain Repository
* Download the ZIP file containing the latest release for my repository.  Inside the ZIP file is a folder holding my repository.  Unzip and place this folder anywhere you want on your computer.

### Step 3 - Virtual Environment
* Open the folder containing my repository files.  Create a command prompt and create a virtual environment with this command:
```
python -m venv .
```
* Then activate the virtual environment:
```
.\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 4 - Update Pip
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
### Step 5 - Install PyTorch
* For Nvidia GPUs:
```
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```
* For AMD GPUs:
```
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.4.2
```
* If you're NOT using GPU acceleration:
```
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

### Step 6 - Doublecheck GPU-acceleration
```
python check_gpu.py
```
### Step 7 - Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<details>
  <summary>üçé Apple</summary>

### Step 1 - GPU Acceleration Software
* All Macs with MacOS 12.3+ come with Metal/MPS support, which is the equivalent of CUDA and ROCm for Nvidia and AMD, respectively.  However, you do need to have [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://www.makeuseof.com/install-xcode-command-line-tools/).

### Step 2 - Obtain Repository
* Download the ZIP file containing the latest release for my repository.  Inside the ZIP file is a folder holding my repository.  Unzip and place this folder anywhere you want on your computer.

### Step 3 - Virtual Environment
* Open the folder containing my repository files.  Create a terminal window and create a virtual environment with this command:
```
python3 -m venv .
```
* Then activate the virtual environment:
```
source bin/activate
```
### Step 5 - Update Pip
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
### Step 6 - Install PyTorch
```
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```
### Step 7 - Doublecheck Metal/MPS-acceleration
```
python3 check_gpu.py
```
### Step 8 - Install Dependencies
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
<details>
  <summary>Instructions</summary>
  
### Step 1 - Virtual Environment
> Open a command prompt within my repository folder and activate the virtual environment:<br>
> NOTE: For Macs the preferred command is ```source bin/activate```
```
.\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 2 - Run Program
```
python gui.py
```
* NOTE: Only systems running Windows with an Nvidia GPU will display metrics in the GUI.  Will fix later so hold tight.

### Step 3 - "Download Embedding Model"
You must wait until the download is complete AND unpacked before trying to create the database.

### Step 4 - "Select Embedding Model Directory"
Selects the directory containing the model you want to use.

### Step 5 - "Choose Documents for Database"
Select one or more files. Currently supports pdf, docx, txt, json, enex, eml, msg, csv, xls, xlsx.  NOTE: You can always remove files from the "Docs_for_DB" folder, but you must recreate the vector database if you don't want them included in the new database.

### Step 6 - "Create Vector Database."
You should see GPU usage spike.  After the spike, the program still needs to "persist" the database to disk .  You must wait for this to complete before trying to query the database.  You can look at the command prompt window to see exactly when the database is "persisted."

### Step 7 - LM Studio
Open LM Studio and load a model.  Only Llama2-based models are currently supported.  Click "Start Server" in the server tab.  Within my program, type your question in the box and submit.  If you don't minimize LM Studio in this process you can actually see it being fed your question and the database results!
> IMPORTANT: You must use the "Default LM Studio Windows" preset and a Llama2 model.  Other models and/or presents might (but not always) prevent it from working.
